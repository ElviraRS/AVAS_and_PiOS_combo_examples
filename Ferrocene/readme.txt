This an example of combining of AVAS with PiOS for ferrocene molecule:
1) pay attention to the AssignTag function, which in this case can be used to adjust the number of electrons on Cp rings
2) you have to modify the ActiveSpaceMaker.py for this application: define separate lists of atoms for Cp rings and AVAS.
